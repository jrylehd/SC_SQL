# Samahang Calumpang Filipino Organization Database
Created a Microsoft Excel mini database for my organization.
Manipulated the database to separate different information into relational tables.
Exported each sheet (table) as CSV files.
Imported the CSV files as tables into a schema on MySQL Workbench.
Queried through some prompts given to me that would translate well in real-world contexts (scdb_query.sql).
